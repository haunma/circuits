    "Explain the basis for this part of the lab.  What are you doing here and why does it work?  What challenges did you encounter and how did you deal with them?  What was the function generator set to, and why was that particular waveshape and frequency chosen?  How did you get data from the oscilloscope, and how did you process it prior to fitting?  Etc. (You may think of more questions to answer.)  You had to be careful in how you adjusted the oscilloscope to get a high-quality capture, and your readers will want to know some details about that too.\n",
