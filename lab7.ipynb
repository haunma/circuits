    "Here you should be explaining the process for choosing your $R$: first picking your desired $f_0$, then measuring $C$, then finding the $R$ required to achieve your $f_0$, then finding the closest value in the drawers, then going back and figuring out what your actual $f_0$ is expected to be.  Of course, because I titled this section \"Low-pass filter design\" you should clarify which of the filter circuits is a low-pass filter.\n",
